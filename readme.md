## Work in progress


The [REhome.WebApp](https://rehome-webapp.herokuapp.com/) performs techno-economic and ecological assessment of buildings.

It helps house owners to estimate the energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with heating the building. Additionally, the user shall be able to apply different refurbishment options for the building envelope and the heat supply system.  The resulting energy and CO2 reduction as well as the incurring costs within the observation period are calculated.
